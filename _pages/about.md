Hello, and welcome to my homepage! 

I am a Postgraduate Associate and CSAP Predoctoral Fellow at the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale University. In September 2025, I will join the Department of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego as a PhD student.

My research focuses on American political institutions, political parties, and quantitative as well as computational methodology. My current work investigates ticket splitting in U.S. federal elections. I use survey data to explore the question: Who are ticket splitters, and what motivates them? To answer this, I employ panel data analysis and machine learning approaches.

More broadly, my work combines a variety of research designs and data sources, including causal inference methods for observational data, text analysis, machine learning, large language models, and game theory.

I hold an MSc in Political Economy from the University of Konstanz and a BA in Political Science and Public Law from the University of Mannheim. Prior to graduate school, I worked as Managing Editor at the peer-reviewed journal  [European Union Politics](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/eup), as a public-sector consultant at [PD-Berater der oeffentlichen Hand](https://www.pd-g.de/), and as a research assistant at New York University for Elisa Maria Wirsching and Hye Young You.
