## Project Summary

In this study, we analyze how a small yet meaningful share of voters chose to split their ticket in the 2024 U.S. Senate races—i.e., they supported one party’s presidential candidate but another party’s Senate candidate. Drawing on data from the Stanford-Arizona-Yale YouGov Panel, we observe how candidate favorability emerges as the **primary** predictor of ticket splitting, surpassing demographic variables and self-reported party identification. 

The **key findings** highlight that:
- Even though demographics and party ID remain stable predictors, **differential favorability** toward Senate candidates becomes increasingly crucial as Election Day approaches.
- Ticket splitting constitutes a small but distinctive fraction—around 3–5% of voters—that can shift close races.
- These “swing voter” behaviors pose important questions about campaign targeting and strategic messaging.
